# ZKCertify

This repository contains a **ZK-based** verification system that enables the generation and validation of attestations across multiple chains (**EDUCHAIN** and **Arbitrum**). The system demonstrates how user data (like CGPA, test score) can be verified and minted into an NFT on the chosen chain.

## Overview
**ZKCertify** leverages **zero-knowledge proofs** to ensure the integrity of user data without exposing the underlying information. It allows recruiters or other parties to:
1. Request verification of a user's credentials (CGPA, test scores).
2. Generate and validate ZK proofs.
3. Mint an NFT as proof of verification on the selected chain (Arbitrum or EDUCHAIN).

---

## Core Idea
1. A **student** registers on the platform and stores their **CGPA**.
2. As the student learns new skills, they can take various **tests** (e.g., skill-based tests).  
3. The system checks if **CGPA + test score** is greater than a defined **threshold**.  
   - If **CGPA + test score ≥ threshold**, the output is **1** (passed).  
   - Otherwise, the output is **0** (not passed).  
4. **Recruiters** can verify these proofs on-chain whenever a student applies for a role.

This approach preserves the student’s privacy (thanks to zero-knowledge proofs) while still allowing recruiters to validate the student’s performance.

## Architecture
Below is a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the major components and data flow:

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png)

- **User** can:
  - Connect/disconnect wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
  - Add CGPA and take tests (which updates verification data).
- **Recruiter** can:
  - Connect wallet.
  - Request verification.
  - Receive the final attestation and NFT minted on the chain of choice (Arbitrum or EDUCHAIN).

---

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 14.x recommended)
- **npm** (>= 6.x)
- **Circom** (for ZK circuit compilation) or Docker-based setup if you prefer
- **MetaMask** (browser extension) for testing the dApp

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/ZKCertify.git
   cd ZKCertify
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Compile ZK Circuit**  
   Go back to the root folder (or wherever your `circuit.circom` file is located) and run:
   ```bash
   npm run complete-circuit
   ```
   This command will:
   - Compile your circuit.
   - Generate the necessary proving and verification keys.
   - Create the witness.

4. **Deploy the zkCertify Contract**  
   You need to deploy the **zkCertify Contract** on both **EDUCHAIN** and **Arbitrum**. Once deployed, update your environment variables with the addresses:
   ```
   EDU_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x147AD899D1773f5De5e064C33088b58c7acb7acf"
   ARB_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x82941a739E74eBFaC72D0d0f8E81B1Dac2f586D5"
   VK_HASH="0xa0e25c80bfa3f16a1f2a971730011a85066bc21027722662136a24fa59a59297"
   ```
   > **Note:** `VK_HASH` is generated by the function in `circuit/setup/hash.js`.

---

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the **`/backend`** directory and add the following entries:
```
ZKV_RPC_URL=
ETH_RPC_URL=

ETH_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
ARB_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
EDU_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=

GROQ_API_KEY=
ZKV_SEED_PHRASE=
ETH_SECRET_KEY=

ARB_URL=
EDU_URL=
```
- **ZKV_RPC_URL**: The RPC endpoint for ZKV (if applicable).
- **ETH_RPC_URL**: The RPC endpoint for Ethereum (or your desired testnet).
- **ETH_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the ZKVerify contract on Ethereum (if applicable).
- **ARB_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the contract deployed on Arbitrum.
- **EDU_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the contract deployed on EDUCHAIN.
- **GROQ_API_KEY**: (If you use any third-party or internal API key).
- **ZKV_SEED_PHRASE**: Seed phrase for the account used in the ZK environment.
- **ETH_SECRET_KEY**: Private key for Ethereum-based deployments.
- **ARB_URL**: RPC endpoint for Arbitrum.
- **EDU_URL**: RPC endpoint for EDUCHAIN.

## Running Locally

1. **Backend**  
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     node app/src/index.js
     ```
   The backend should now be running on the specified port (default is usually `http://localhost:3001`).

2. **Frontend**  
   - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   By default, this starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet** (e.g., MetaMask) on the website.  
2. **Register / Add CGPA / Take Test** to generate or update your user data.  
3. **Generate Proof** which uses the underlying **ZK circuit** to prove your credentials (CGPA + Test Score).  
4. **Select a Chain** (Arbitrum or EDUCHAIN) to mint the verification NFT.  
5. **Recruiters** can connect their wallets to verify your credentials and see proof on-chain.  

---

## Future Plans
- **Additional Tests**: DSA, Assignments, Interviews, automatically checked by AI.  
- **Job Postings**: Recruiters can post openings with required skills, and the platform can suggest suitable students.  
- **Resume as NFT**: Students can mint their verified resume as an NFT on the chain of their choice.
