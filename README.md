# ZKCertify

This repository contains a **ZK-based** verification system that enables the generation and validation of attestations across multiple chains (EDUCHAIN and Arbitrum). The system also demonstrates how user data (like CGPA, test score) can be verified and minted into an NFT on the chosen chain.

## Overview
ZKVerify leverages **zero-knowledge proofs** to ensure the integrity of user data without exposing the underlying information. It allows recruiters or other parties to:
1. Request verification of a user's credentials (CGPA, test scores).
2. Generate and validate ZK proofs.
3. Mint an NFT as proof of verification on the selected chain.

## Architecture
Below is a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the major components and data flow:

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png)

- **User** can:
  - Connect/disconnect wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
  - Add CGPA and take tests (which updates verification data).
- **Recruiter** can:
  - Connect wallet.
  - Request verification.
  - Receive the final attestation and NFT minted on the chain of choice (Arbitrum or EDUCHAIN).

---

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 14.x recommended)
- **npm** (>= 6.x)
- **Circom** (for ZK circuit compilation) or Docker-based setup if you prefer
- **MetaMask** (browser extension) for testing the dApp

---

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/ZKVerify.git
   cd ZKVerify
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Compile ZK Circuit**  
   Go back to the root folder (or wherever your `circuit.circom` file is located) and run:
   ```bash
   npm run complete-circuit
   ```
   This command will:
   - Compile your circuit.
   - Generate the necessary proving and verification keys.
   - Create the witness.

4. **Deploy the zkCertify Contract**  
   You need to deploy the **zkCertify Contract** on both **EDUCHAIN** and **Arbitrum**. Once deployed, update your environment variables with the addresses:
   ```
   EDU_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x147AD899D1773f5De5e064C33088b58c7acb7acf"
   ARB_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x82941a739E74eBFaC72D0d0f8E81B1Dac2f586D5"
   VK_HASH="0xa0e25c80bfa3f16a1f2a971730011a85066bc21027722662136a24fa59a59297"
   ```
   > **Note:** `VK_HASH` is generated by the function in `circuit/setup/hash.js`.

---

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the **`/backend`** directory and add the following entries:
```
ZKV_RPC_URL=
ETH_RPC_URL=

ETH_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
ARB_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
EDU_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=

GROQ_API_KEY=
ZKV_SEED_PHRASE=
ETH_SECRET_KEY=

ARB_URL=
EDU_URL=
```
- **ZKV_RPC_URL**: The RPC endpoint for ZKV.
- **ETH_RPC_URL**: The RPC endpoint for Ethereum (or your desired testnet).
- **ETH_ZKVERIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the ZKVerify contract on Ethereum (if applicable).
- **ARB_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the contract deployed on Arbitrum.
- **EDU_ZKCERTIFY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: Address of the contract deployed on EDUCHAIN.
- **GROQ_API_KEY**: (If you use any third-party or internal API key).
- **ZKV_SEED_PHRASE**: Seed phrase for the account used in the ZK environment.
- **ETH_SECRET_KEY**: Private key for Ethereum-based deployments.
- **ARB_URL**: RPC endpoint for Arbitrum.
- **EDU_URL**: RPC endpoint for EDUCHAIN.

## Running Locally
1. **Backend**  
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     node app/src/index.js
     ```
   The backend should now be running on the specified port (default is usually `http://localhost:3001` or whichever is set in your code).

2. **Frontend**  
   - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies (if you haven’t already):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   By default, this starts on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

## Usage
1. **Connect Wallet** (e.g., MetaMask) on the website.  
2. **Add CGPA / Take Test** to generate or update your user data.  
3. **Generate Proof** which uses the underlying **ZK circuit** to prove your credentials.  
4. **Select a Chain** (Arbitrum or EDUCHAIN) to mint the verification NFT.  
5. **Recruiters** can connect their wallets to verify your credentials and see proof on-chain.
